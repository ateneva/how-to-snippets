### Install the Monitoring and Logging agents

Agents collect data and then send or stream info to Cloud Monitoring in the Cloud Console.

TheÂ _Cloud Monitoring agent_Â is a collectd-based daemon that gathers system and application metrics from virtual machine instances and sends them to Monitoring. By default, the Monitoring agent collects disk, CPU, network, and process metrics. Configuring the Monitoring agent allows third-party applications to get the full list of agent metrics. SeeÂ [Cloud Monitoring agent overview](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent)Â for more information.



In this section, you install theÂ _Cloud Logging agent_Â to stream logs from your VM instances to Cloud Logging. Later in this lab, you see what logs are generated when you stop and start your VM.

It is best practice to run the Cloud Logging agent on all your VM instances.

#### **Install agents on the VM:**

*   Run the Monitoring agent install script command in the SSH terminal of your VM instance to install the Cloud Monitoring agent.

```bash
curl -sSO https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/add-monitoring-agent-repo.sh
sudo bash add-monitoring-agent-repo.sh
```



```bash
sudo apt-get update
```



```bash
sudo apt-get install stackdriver-agent
```

When asked if you want to continue, enterÂ **Y**.

*   Run the Logging agent install script command in the SSH terminal of your VM instance to install the Cloud Logging agent

```bash
curl -sSO https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/add-logging-agent-repo.sh
sudo bash add-logging-agent-repo.sh
```



```bash
sudo apt-get update
```



```bash
sudo apt-get install google-fluentd
```
